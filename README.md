# Cuis-Smalltalk-startupScripts
A few scripts I use to start Cuis in the way i like

###  How to use it
* I call **cuis** the directory containing *Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev*.
* Clone this repository in the directory **cuis**
* enter the directory just cloned and run `./makeLinks.sh`
* Now in **cuis** you will have two links to scripts to run Cuis conveniently.
